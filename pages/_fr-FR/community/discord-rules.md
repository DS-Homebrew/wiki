## Conséquences

The consequences of breaking these rules are a warning, mute, kick or ban. Of course, the specific consequences will be handled on a case by case basis.
- Most users end up having 4 warnings before they are banned
   - These warnings include using the actual !warn command, getting muted, and also verbal warnings
- Joining for the purpose of rule breaking will get you banned

## Rapport

- If someone is breaking the rules and a moderator is already not handling the case, please ping an online moderator
- If the incident was in DMs, there needs to be evidence, such as other people reporting it too, implications on the server, or anything of the sort
- However, when doing your report, cover any links; do not give the DM advertiser more visibility than they already got by Direct Messaging everyone
