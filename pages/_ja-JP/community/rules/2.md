### 2. プロジェクト開発サーバーで設定された基準に従うこと

- 質問するために質問するのは皮肉であるだけでなく、#nds-helpのようなヘルプチャンネルを持つ意味を失う。
- Arbitrary release dates aren't part of our schedule to publish high quality tested applications, and expecting them to be pre-determined/ready on demand interferes with our release schedule. Those not wanting to be constrained by these limitations should instead use nightly builds if the project offers it
- Handholding is not helping; users are expected to do research on the subject matter, whether it's by reading the pinned messages/#useful-resources or using a search engine to find links
   - Overlooking this rule for legitimate reasons is allowed, at moderators decision on what is considered legitimate
