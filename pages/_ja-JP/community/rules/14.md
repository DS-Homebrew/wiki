### 14. Do not try to evade the rules as this will be treated as breaking them

- If you don't understand any of the rules, feel free to ask for further clarification
- Breaking the rules and then claiming that you “didn’t know” will still make you guilty of breaking them
- Trying to get around the rules by speaking in vague terms also counts as breaking them
