### 3. Keep a positive-environment in the server

- Curse words aren't prohibited (you're on the internet; expect it), but edgelords and slurs aren't welcome
- Conversational rants are allowed as long as it's not purely for the sake of venting
    - Prevent discussions being repeats of frustrations already found so commonly elsewhere (ie: Twitter) by introducing another factor not well known or discussed
    - Starting off a topic with something bad to say about it? Make sure to not instantly start the whole convo to be negative
