#### Why does my 3DS get stuck on black screens, crash, power off, etc when launching TWiLight Menu++?
TWL_FIRM이 알 수 없는 이유로 망가졌을 수 있습니다. 문제를 해결하기 위해 다음 가이드를 따르세요: <https://3ds.hacks.guide/troubleshooting#dsi--ds-functionality-is-broken-after-completing-the-guide>

#### TWiLight Menu++를 부팅할 때 하얀 화면만 떠있는 문제는 어떻게 고칠 수 있나요?
- Reboot the console
- 이래도 효과가 없으면, 사용중인 SD카드를 파일 시스템은 FAT32, 할당 단위 크기는 32 KB로 설정하고 포맷하세요 (용어는 윈도우 파일 탐색기 기준).
- 이렇게까지 했는데도 효과가 없으면, 다른 SD카드로 시도해보세요.

#### Where is the Acekard/Wood UI theme?
The Acekard (also called Wood UI) theme was removed due to its buggy behavior and causing SD card corruption. Please wait for a fix. Progress for the return of this theme can be found in [this PR](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/pull/1109).

#### How do I fix TWiLight Menu++ restarting or giving a Guru Meditation Error when launching a game?
Go into TWLMenu++ Settings, and disable `Update recently played list`.

#### Why do I get a white screen when trying to load a DS game from SD card?
See [I’m having issues with my ROM(s), what should I do?](../nds-bootstrap/faq?faq=im-having-issues-with-my-roms-what-should-i-do) on the nds-bootstrap FAQ page.

#### How do I use cheats?
You need to have a cheat DB in the form of a `usrcheat.dat` file in the `sd:/_nds/TWiLightMenu/extras/` folder. The most updated cheat database is [DeadSkullzJr's NDS(i) Cheat Databases](https://gbatemp.net/threads/488711/).
- On the 3DS, this database is available in the Universal-Updater app as "NDS(i) Cheat Databases". This will automatically install it to the required location.

Alternatively, you can use [r4cce](http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA013928/soft_en.html) to create your own cheat DB.

#### How do I show a custom picture on the top screen of the DSi theme?
A random `.png` image in `sd:/_nds/TWiLightMenu/dsimenu/photos/` will be shown each time the menu is loaded. If there are no applicable images, screenshots taken by nds-bootstrap will be used instead.

- The images(s) must be no bigger than 208x156
- If you have errors, it's most likely an error with the image size. Please use [tinypng](https://tinypng.com) to reduce the size

#### How do I get games?
You can download homebrew games from [Universal-DB](https://db.universal-team.net/ds) and [GameBrew](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/List_of_all_DS_homebrew#Games). To get dumps of your retail games:
- On DS you can use [GodMode9i](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i/releases) to dump your GBA games and, if you have a Slot-2 flashcart, DS games. If you only have a Slot-1 flashcard and would like to dump a DS game, you can use [Wooddumper](https://digiex.net/attachments/wooddumper_r89-zip.14735/), which requires a Wi-Fi connection compatible with the DS, as well as an FTP client on a separate device to receive the ROM
- On DSi you can use [GodMode9i](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i/releases) to dump your DS games and DSiWare
- On 3DS you can use [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases) to dump your DS games, DSiWare, and Virtual Console titles

#### Can I get the save files from my Game Cards onto my SD card or vice versa?
Yes. You can use [Checkpoint](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint/releases) on 3DS, or [GodMode9i](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i/releases) on DSi / 3DS.

#### How do I change TWiLight Menu++'s language?
1. TWiLight Menu++의 설정을 여세요. TWiLight Menu++가 로딩될 때 <kbd>SELECT</kbd>버튼을 누르면 바로 설정으로 넘어갈 수 있습니다.
1. Change the first option until you see the language you want, then exit settings
   - You may also want to change the first three options on the nds-bootstrap settings page as they control the language and region of DS games and their titles in TWiLight Menu++

#### Is this a DS(i) emulator?
No, this is not an emulator. The menu and DS games (loaded via nds-bootstrap) are ran natively in the console's DS/DSi mode. The only consoles emulated are the past consoles, but partially for GBA (as some or all parts like graphics are ran natively).

#### What systems does TWiLight Menu++ support?
See [List of Systems Supported by TWiLight Menu++](../ds-index/emulators#list-of-supported-systems-by-twilight-menu).

#### Can exploits of Slot-1 games boot TWiLight Menu++?
No. SD card access is only granted to DSiWare applications, so Slot-1 games cannot launch (or even access) TWiLight Menu++.

#### Why can't I find/see my games?
There are a multiple reasons you may be unable to find them.
- The `_nds` folder found on the root of the SD card is not intended for applications one would access via TWiLight Menu++, due to its reservation for functionality based files (skins, configuration, images, emulators and more). If you've placed your titles here, please move them to another location.
- If you have more than 39 items in a folder and all of the slots on the menu are taken, your games may be on the next page. Use <kbd class="l">L</kbd>/<kbd class="r">R</kbd> or <kbd>SELECT</kbd> + <kbd>Left</kbd>/<kbd>Right</kbd> to switch pages
- If your game or folder is hidden, you may need to show hidden files via TWiLight Menu++'s GUI settings
- If your game is in an archive (`zip`, `rar`, `7z`, etc), it cannot be used by TWiLight Menu++. Extract the game from the archive to use it
- If your game does not use one of the [supported extensions](../ds-index/emulators#list-of-systems-supported-by-twilight-menu), you may have to change the extension by renaming the file

#### How do I access TWiLight Menu++ settings?
The way to access the TWiLight Menu++ settings varies between your configuration.
- **DS Classic Menu:** Tap the DS icon at the bottom of the lower screen
- **Nintendo DSi/SEGA Saturn/Homebrew Launcher themes: using SELECT Menu:** Press <kbd>SELECT</kbd>, then launch the Settings Applet (use the D-PAD to highlight options)
- **Nintendo DSi/SEGA Saturn/Homebrew Launcher themes not using SELECT Menu:** Hitting <kbd>SELECT</kbd> will bring you to the DS Classic Menu
- **Nintendo 3DS theme:** Tap the the wrench icon on the lower screen
- **R4 Original theme:** Hit <kbd>START</kbd> (if you’re in the file browser), then hit <kbd>SELECT</kbd>

You can also hold <kbd>SELECT</kbd> while launching TWiLight Menu++ to directly access the settings.
