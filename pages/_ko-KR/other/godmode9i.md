Information for [GodMode9i](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i), a full access file browser for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo DSi and the Nintendo 3DS's TWL_FIRM.

### FAQ & Troubleshooting

#### How do I get past the "mounting drive(s)" screen while starting it up?
This happens when you launch GodMode9i from [hiyaCFW](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/other/hiyacfw). You can hold X while launching GodMode9i to skip NAND mounting. Alternatively, you can launch GodMode9i directly from unlaunch to be able to mount the NAND.

#### Why can't I dump games on DSi?
You need unlaunch installed in order to be able to dump games onto your SD card. You can install unlaunch by following [dsi.cfw.guide](https://dsi.cfw.guide/).
