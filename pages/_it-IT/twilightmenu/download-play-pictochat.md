If you're using a DSi console, you should already be able to launch those apps. Otherwise, if you have a 3DS, proceed below.

In GodMode9:
- Press the Home/Power button
- Select `Title Manager`, then select `[1:] NAND / TWL`
- Find and select `DS Download Play (NTR-HDNA)`
- Select `Open title folder`
- Select `00000000.tmd`, then select `TMD file options...`
- Select `Dump CXI/NDS file`
- Done. The file will be in `0:/gm9/out/`.

Copy `DS Download Play (NTR-HDNA).nds` to `0:/_nds/`, and rename it to `dlplay.nds`.

The above steps will increase DLP boot speed.

To run Pictochat on 3DS (DSi required):
- Copy `pictochat.nds` from `sd:/_nds/` on the DSi's SD card to the same location on the 3DS' SD card You must first access the DS Classic Menu in TWiLight Menu++ on the DSi.
