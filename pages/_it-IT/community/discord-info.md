Questo è un server discord dedicato a tutto ciò che riguarda il modding e l'homebrew del Nintendo DS(i), dall'aiutarti a configurare la tua flashcard allo sviluppo di homebrew. This server also has a focus on other things such as creating ROM hacks, playing DS games, and TWL_FIRM modding on 3DS.

## Canali Discord
Abbiamo molti canali per diversi argomenti, quidni assicurati di star usando il canale giusto in modo tale che gli altri non vengano riempiti di conversazioni fuori tema.

Always remember to check the channel topic and pinned messages before talking in a channel.

## Ruoli & Flair utenti
There are several roles you can get on the server, some of them being accessible with just a [Lightning bot command](#lightning-commands).

### Moderator Roles
These roles are given to people that are well trusted to maintain the server. They have the ability to ban, kick, mute, and give other roles to users.

- Da Master - The owner's role
- Admin - Has all possible permissions, usually gets final say between the Server Maintainers
- Server Maintainers - Help enforce the server rules and manage the server. If there is an issue, contact them first before going higher up

### User Flair Roles
These roles can only be given by moderators, and indicate that these users are knowledgeable in those fields, some give access to private channels. If you think that you fit the descriptions for any of these roles, ask in #community-meta. Moderators will evaluate your request based on the role's requirements.

- Developers - This role is given to those who have contributed code to the Nintendo DS scene. If you have any projects for the role, show them in #nds-dev
- Helpers - This role is given to those that actively provide meaningful assistance in #nds-help or have contributed to compatibility reporting
   - Helpers have no moderator permissions, please ping a moderator if a situation needs one
- Nitro Booster - Automatically given to those that have given Server Boosts to the server. This role has no additional permissions, and is not hoisted in the Member List

### Punishment Roles
If you have broken the rules, you may receive these roles from a moderator.

- No Community - Removes access for all the channels under the Community category
- No Help - Removes access from [#nds-help][nds-help]
- No Reaction - Disables reaction permissions for all channels

### Altro
These roles are only given for very specific purposes by moderators.

- Bots - Used to mark the Discord bots in the server
- Special Thanks - People that have contributed to the community in a major way

## Lightning Commands
Lightning is a Discord bot made by [LightSage](https://github.com/LightSage) which has useful commands for modding communities. The most common command used is `!togglerole`, which will give you any of the following roles below:

- Updates - Get pings for updates on new releases of DS(i) homebrew in #announcements
- Nintendo DS Online Players - Anyone can ping this role in #nds-gaming when they're looking for people to play DS games online with
- Artist/Designers - For those that have made high-quality TWiLight Menu++ skins, unlaunch backgrounds or graphics for other DS(i) homebrew
- Composers - For those that have made music for DS(i) homebrew or ROM hacks
- Game Modders - For those that have made ROM hacks, cheats, or any other type of modifications to DS(i) games
- Translators - Anyone that wants to be notified for contributing to translations of various DS-Homebrew projects

There are a ton of fun commands you can run as well, but please keep them to [#end-of-server][end-of-server]. To learn more, check out their website: <https://lightning.lightsage.dev/>

**Lightning is also used for moderation purposes (to log warns, kicks, mutes, and bans). Keep Direct Messages enabled in the server in case we ever need to reach you.**

## The Staff Team
These are the people who maintain the server. If they say something is final, it is not up for debate. These members are hoisted in the Member List. Do not ask to be a part of the team, as it will decrease your chance of getting accepted. Members will be added to the team if and when seen fit.
