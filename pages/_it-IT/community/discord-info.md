description: Informazioni su il server Discord DS⁽ⁱ⁾ Mode Hacking
---

Questo è un server discord dedicato a tutto ciò che riguarda il modding e l'homebrew del Nintendo DS(i), dall'aiutarti a configurare la tua flashcard allo sviluppo di homebrew. Ci concentriamo anche su altre cose come la creazione di ROM hack, giocare a giochi per DS e modding TWL_FIRM su 3DS.

## Canali Discord
Abbiamo molti canali per diversi argomenti, quidni assicurati di star usando il canale giusto in modo tale che gli altri non vengano riempiti di conversazioni fuori tema.

Ricordati sempre di controllare l'argomento del canale e i messaggi attaccati prima di parlare in un canale.
