description: How to get box art/game covers in TWiLight Menu++
---

1. Download a png box art pack from [GameTDB](https://www.gametdb.com/DS/Downloads#cover_packs), under the **S Covers (png)** category
1. Extract the .png files to `sd:/_nds/TWiLightMenu/boxart`
1. Make sure box art is set to be shown in TWiLight Menu++ settings

**To add your own box art:** Place them in `sd:/_nds/TWiLightMenu/boxart`.
- Can either have the game's TID (ex. `ASME.png`), or the filename (ex. `SM64DS.nds.png`)
- Must be in `.png` format, with the recommended size of 128x115 and maximum of 208x143
- If your **TW**i**L**ight Menu++ configuration has Box Art viewing set to `Cached`, the image size must be 44 KiB or below. You can use a tool like [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) to compress the images to an acceptable size

Individual box art can also be downloaded from GameTDB, under the **S Covers (png)** category.
