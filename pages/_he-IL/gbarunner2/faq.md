#### How do I create and add custom borders?

You can read and follow [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owjiW-1fHEbokrkK2ZuPFjR2-N9s1dXCCAM3ghWRtxk/edit?usp=sharing) by FrescoASF.

#### Are cheats supported?

Not right now. Instead, you can permanently inject cheat codes into your GBA ROM with [GBAATM](https://gbatemp.net/threads/gba-auto-trainer-maker-gbaatm.99334/).

#### How do I use nightly GBARunner2 builds in TWiLight Menu++?

1. Download the nightly build
1. Rename it to `GBARunner2_arm7dldi_3ds.nds` (or `GBARunner2_arm7dldi_dsi.nds` if you're on DSi)
1. Place it in `sd:_nds`

#### How do I use Wi-Fi link features?

You will need a build from the [wifi_link](https://github.com/Gericom/GBARunner2/tree/wifi_link) branch to use the features. You can find detailed instructions on how to setup the builds on its [GBATemp Wiki page](https://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/GBARunner2/Link).
