### 2. Follow standards set in project-development servers

- Asking to ask is not only ironic, but defeats the point of having a help channel such as #nds-help, where all help questions are intended to be directed towards
- Arbitrary release dates aren't part of our schedule to publish high quality tested applications, and expecting them to be pre-determined/ready on demand interferes with our release schedule. Those not wanting to be constrained by these limitations should instead use nightly builds if the project offers it
- Handholding is not helping; users are expected to do research on the subject matter, whether it's by reading the pinned messages/#useful-resources or using a search engine to find links
    - Overlooking this rule for legitimate reasons is allowed, at moderators decision on what is considered legitimate
