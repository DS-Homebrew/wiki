GBARunner2 is an [open-source](https://github.com/Gericom/GBARunner2) hypervisor that runs GBA games on DS / DSi / 3DS in DS mode. Basically, like [Nintendont](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont) does for running GameCube games on Wii.

Along with what this wiki has to offer, the GBARunner compatibility lists have a lot of useful information:
