[hiyaCFW](https://github.com/RocketRobz/hiyaCFW) is a custom firmware that will allow you to run your system NAND (internal storage) off of your SD card.

This allows you to install your own apps to the Nintendo DSi Menu without risk of bricking, as theyâ€™re installed to the SD card so problems can fixed easily.

It also allows easy installation of homebrew applications to the DSi Menu and displaying a custom splash screen on boot.
