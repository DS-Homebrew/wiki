### Compatibility List
To view tested games, look [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LRTkXOUXraTMjg1eedz_f7b5jiuyMv2x6e_jY_nyHSc/). If you want to contribute, press `view only` and then `request edit access`.

### Tips For Testing Games
- Look for screen flickering or sound issues
- If something looks off, run the game along a console not using nds-bootstrap to compare
- Try as many features in the game as possible
- Try different settings for running the game (ARM9 CPU Speed, Card read DMA, Async card read, etc)
- Be thorough
