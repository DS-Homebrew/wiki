[nds-bootstrap](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/nds-bootstrap) is an open-source homebrew application which redirects Slot-1 read/writes from official Nintendo SDK games to the SD card, whether on a flashcard or the on-console SD card.

It also has a sub-project where it can run old homebrew meant for flashcards on a Nintendo DSi/3DS SD card.
