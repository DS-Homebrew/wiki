title: Flashcard Firmwares
---

This page will attempt to provide a comprehensive guide to which firmware, kernel or system files you need to download for your flashcart.
We prioritize updated operating systems over the official and unsupported ones. For example, we would rather direct users to Wood R4 rather than the original R4 system files which haven't been updated for years.

The list should be grouped by brand and sorted alphabetically. Use the Table of Contents box on the right/above this text to navigate this list. It should be titled "List of Firmwares"

Once you've grabbed your System Files, go to [the TWiLight Menu++ setup page](twilight).

- "Clone" flashcarts are copies of original cards. Example: the M3 Simply is a clone of the original R4 DS. Systems that run on the R4 DS run the same way on the M3 Simply.
- A "fake" flashcart is a device that steals the name of an original card, but that is nothing like it. Example: the R4 Upgrade is a fake R4 DS, it is not compatible with any of the system files available for the R4 DS (a fake card uses its own separate system files).
- A card can be both a clone and a fake. Most fake R4 cards are clones of the Acekard 2i and DSTT.
- Keep in mind that every R4 card (except for the original) is indeed a clone/fake, and [that (almost) all R4i-SDHC/R4iSDHC carts are the same.](https://gbatemp.net/threads/proof-that-almost-all-r4i-sdhc-r4isdhc-carts-are-literally-the-same-carts.514539/)
