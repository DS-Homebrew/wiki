[^1]: DS games will run at 67mhz, but most can be configured to run at 133mhz, though certain games will have issues.
[^2]: The DS Phat was originally thought to have a frontlit TN display, however it was later found to have a Transflective TN Backlit display. See [this video by makho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84H5SJFJRlU) for a detailed explanation.
[^3]: When launching in DS(i) mode, the screens are not properly scaled, and will not appear pixel-perfect. Holding START or SELECT button will disable screen scaling, but will reveal black borders around the screen images.
[^4]: Later Phat models have the same brightness levels as the Lite model, but will require FlashMe to be installed in order to use those levels (at least in the original menu).
[^5]: The only game known to have a compatibility issue is *MegaMan Battle Network 4: Blue Moon* which crashes after the Capcom logo. This only occurs on the DS Phat and not the DS Lite. See [this page](https://mgba.io/2017/05/29/holy-grail-bugs/#mega-man-battle-network-4) where the issue is detailed by mGBA dev endrift.
[^6]: Large GBA Video ROMs (above 32MB) will not work. Gyro and rumble features will also not work.
[^7]: Majority of supported titles do not require the camera. See [this page](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/blob/master/universal/include/compatibleDSiWareMap.h) for which titles are supported. **TW**i**L**ight Menu++ is required to be installed on your flashcard.
[^8]: If you're using **TW**i**L**ight Menu++ with either `DSiWare Booter` setting set to `nds-bootstrap` or if using a 3DS/2DS, then compatibility is near-perfect.
