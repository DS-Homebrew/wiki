[GodMode9i](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i) is a file browser for the Nintendo DS ecosystem, taking inspiration from GodMode9 for the Nintendo 3DS. Dump cartridges, manage SD card files, browse NitroFS and more.

## Dumping functionality

To dump your cartridges, select the drive in the drives list and follow the on-screen prompts.
- Nintendo DS (Lite) consoles can dump Slot-2/Game Boy Advance cartridges if running from Slot-1, or Slot-1/Nintendo DS cartridges if running from Slot-2
- On the Nintendo DSi family of systems, launch GodMode9i with Unlaunch installed to allow access to dump Slot-1.
   - Follow [dsi.cfw.guide](https://dsi.cfw.guide/) for instructions on how to install Unlaunch.
- On the Nintendo 3DS family of systems, launch GodMode9i from a CFW-environment
   - Follow [3ds.hacks.guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/) for instructions on how to install Luma3DS + B9S

### Troubleshooting

#### How do I get past the "mounting drive(s)" screen while starting it up?
This happens when you launch GodMode9i from [hiyaCFW](/hiyacfw). You can hold X while launching GodMode9i to skip NAND mounting. Alternatively, you can launch GodMode9i directly from unlaunch to be able to mount the NAND.
