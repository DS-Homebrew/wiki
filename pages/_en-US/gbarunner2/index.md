GBARunner2 is an [open-source](https://github.com/Gericom/GBARunner2) hypervisor that runs GBA games on DS/DSi/3DS in DS mode. Basically, like [Nintendont](https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont) does for running Gamecube games on Wii.

Along with what this wiki has to offer, the GBARunner compability lists have a lot of userful infomation:
- [DS/Flashcart](https://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/GBARunner2)
- [DSi/3DS](https://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/GBARunner2/DSi_3DS_Compatibility_List)
