title: DS⁽ⁱ⁾ Mode Hacking Info
description: Information for the DS⁽ⁱ⁾ Mode Hacking Discord server
---

This is a Discord server that specializes in all things related to Nintendo DS(i) modding and homebrew, from helping set up your flashcard to homebrew development. We also focus on other things such as creating ROM hacks, playing DS games, and TWL_FIRM modding on 3DS.

## Discord Channels
There are plenty of channels for different topics, so make sure you're using the right channel so the others don't get flooded with unrelated conversations.

Always remember to check the channel topic and pins before talking in a channel.
