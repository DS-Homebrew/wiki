description: Information for the DS⁽ⁱ⁾ Mode Hacking Discord server
---

This is a Discord server that specializes in all things related to Nintendo DS(i) modding and homebrew, from helping set up your flashcard to homebrew development. This server also has a focus on other things such as creating ROM hacks, playing DS games, and TWL_FIRM modding on 3DS.

## Discord Channels
There are plenty of channels for different topics, so make sure you're using the right channel so the others don't get flooded with unrelated conversations.

Always remember to check the channel topic and pinned messages before talking in a channel.

## Roles & User Flairs
There are several roles you can get on the server, some of them being accessible with just a [Lightning bot command](#lightning-commands).

### User Flair Roles
These roles can only be given by moderators, and indicate that these users are knowledgeable in those fields, some give access to private channels. If you think that you fit the descriptions for any of these roles, ask in #community-meta. Moderators will evaluate your request based on the role's requirements.

- Updates - Get pings for updates on new releases of DS(i) homebrew in #announcements
- Nintendo DS Online Players - Anyone can ping this role in #nds-gaming when they're looking for people to play DS games online with

To learn more, check out their website: <https://lightning.lightsage.dev/>

**Lightning is also used for moderation purposes (to log warns, kicks, mutes, and bans). Keep Direct Messages enabled in the server in case we ever need to reach you.**

## The Staff Team
These are the people who maintain the server. If they say something is final, it is not up for debate. These members are hoisted in the Member List. Do not ask to be a part of the team, as it will decrease your chance of getting accepted. Members will be added to the team if and when seen fit.
