### 11. Do not send unsolicited DMs to other users

- Please ask before sending a Direct Message to others and respect those not wanting to communicate
   - Even if your actions aren't malicious, they could be disturbing or otherwise unwanted
- Things that happen in Direct Messages **are** the business of the server since unless you both share another server or are friends, you wouldn't be able to reach each other
- Examples of what not to do include DM advertising, purposely redirecting users to DMs from normal chat (such as support) to break rules, and harassment
