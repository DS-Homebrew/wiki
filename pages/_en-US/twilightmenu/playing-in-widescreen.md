Requires an Old/New Nintendo 3DS or 2DS console.

**Preparation**
* Make sure Luma's `boot.firm` is on the SD root for this to work.
* If you used TWiLight Menu++ Updater or Universal-Updater to update, please install the latest TWiLight Menu++ CIAs using FBI.

1. Download [TWPatch](https://puu.sh/G8sEO/87b4c649e3.cia) ([GBATemp thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/twpatcher-ds-i-mode-screen-filters-and-patches.542694/)).
1. In Luma config, enable external FIRMs and modules.
1. Install the TWPatch CIA.
1. Launch TWPatch.
1. Press X+START to generate a `TwlBg.cxi` file with widescreen.
   - If the top screen doesn't indicate that wide patch is enabled, start from step 4 again.
   - If widescreen still doesn't work, wait for RTCom-activated widescreen to be released.
1. In the TWiLight Menu++ settings, switch the page to `Misc settings`, and set `Screen Aspect Ratio` to `16:10`.
   - This can be done per-game as well.

You're all done! Enjoy your DS games in widescreen!    

**NOTE1**: Every game/app in DS(i) mode will run in widescreen, even the games that aren't compatible with widescreen.     
For this to be fixed so only the widescreen-compatible games run in widescreen, wait for RTCom-activated widescreen to be released.

**NOTE2:**
Do not hold `START` or `SELECT` when launching TWLMenu++, if you don't want widescreen to look glitched.     
If you don't see the screen aspect ratio setting, wait for RTCom-activated widescreen to be released.

Not every game is widescreen compatible. [We have created a list of games with widescreen](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/blob/master/7zfile/3DS%20-%20CFW%20users/Games%20supported%20with%20widescreen.txt)
