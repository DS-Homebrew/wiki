{:.alert .alert-info}

### Installing
1. Download the latest [`TWiLightMenu-DSi.7z`](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases/latest/download/TWiLightMenu-DSi.7z)
    - If it does not download, see the [release page](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases/latest)
1. Extract `TWiLightMenu-DSi.7z`
1. Copy the `_nds` folder to your SD card root
1. Copy the `BOOT.NDS` file to your SD card root
1. Copy the `roms` folder to your SD card root
1. **hiyaCFW users:** Copy the `title` folder to your SD card root

### Autobooting with Unlaunch
1. Turn on your DSi while holding <kbd class="face">A</kbd> and <kbd class="face">B</kbd>
1. In the Unlaunch menu, go to `OPTIONS`
1. Set `NO BUTTON` or a button of your choice to the `TWiLight Menu++` that says `BOOT.NDS` on the bottom screen

### Accessing flashcard contents

A flashcard is something that goes in the game card slot, and contains a microSD card slot. If you do not have a flashcard, you are done with this guide.

#### If you don't have an R4(i) Ultra
