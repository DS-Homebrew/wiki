### Custom Game Icons and Banners
1. Download the icon or banner you want to set from [the Skins site](https://skins.ds-homebrew.com/icon/)
   - Banners have a `.bin` file extension, they include custom game titles and its icons can be still or animated. These files are can only be set for roms.
   - Icons have a `.png` file exension and will only be shown as still images. These can be set for both folders and roms.
   - Any `.png` file that's 4 bits in color depth and 32x32 pixels or less in resolution can also be used, not only the ones present in the the Skins site.
1. Put the icon/banner file in `sd:\_nds\TWiLightMenu\icons`
   - If it's a custom icon for a folder, rename the file so that its name is the same as the name of the folder in which you want the icon to be displayed.
   - If it's a custom icon or banner for a rom, rename the file so that its name is the same as the rom whose icon you want to replace. Note the the name has to include the file extension, e.g. `ASME.nds.png` or `ASME.nds.bin` if you want the icon/banner to show for the rom `ASME.nds`. This works not only for `.nds` roms, but for all roms that can be ran from TWiLight Menu++.
