TWiLightMenu supports custom sound files in themes. Place your sound files under the `sound` subdirectory in your theme folder, for example for the `white` theme, you would place the files at `themes/white/sound/sfx.bin` and `themes/sound/bgm.pcm.raw` respectively. Both files are optional, if one is missing the default music will be used. You should then also set the music option in settings to "Theme".

These instructions assume you have devkitPro installed with mmutil. You can get devkitPro at the [devkitPro website](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).

## Sound Effect Bank
The sound effect bank contains sound effects such as the icon select sound, etc.

| File        | Description                                                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| startup.wav | Played on startup. See the section on [Startup sound](#startup-sound) for more details |
| back.wav    | Back                                                                                   |
| launch.wav  | Played when launching a game                                                           |
| select.wav  | Played when moving the select cursor                                                   |
| wrong.wav   | Played when reaching the end of the page                                               |
| switch.wav  | Played when switching pages                                                            |
| stop.wav    | Played on the DSi Theme when the select cursor stops moving                            |
| menu.wav    | Not part of the soundbank. See the section on [Menu BGM](#menu-bgm) for more details   |

You can then run `make` to make the sound effect bank. All files listed above, except *menu.wav* are required, but you can make them silent.

Your resulting *sfx.bin* **must be under 512000B = 512KB**. Any larger will result in either crashes or some sounds not playing fully.

### Startup sound
While the other sound effects will work with any WAV file, the startup sound must be in a specific format in order to work properly, otherwise there will be a gap between when the startup sound stops and the background music begins.

The startup.wav file must be **16-bit 16kHz**. You can use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) for example to convert to this format. Once the file is loaded in Audacity, change the **Project Rate (Hz)** to **16000**, then press **Shift+M**, and change the **Format** to **16-bit PCM**.

If your file is in Stereo, you should also go to **Tracks > Mix > Mix Stereo down to Mono**.

You must set `PlayStartupJingle=1` in your `theme.ini` for the startup jingle to play.


## Menu BGM

To create custom menu BGM, you will need to install [SoX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/files/sox/14.4.2/sox-14.4.2-win32.exe/download).

Menu BGM is created from **menu.wav**, which must be **16-bit 16kHz Mono**. You can use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) for example to convert to this format. Once the file is loaded in Audacity, change the **Project Rate (Hz)** to **16000**, then press **Shift+M**, and change the **Format** to **16-bit PCM**.

If your file is in Stereo, you should also go to **Tracks > Mix > Mix Stereo down to Mono**.

If SoX is installed, once you run `make`, you will get a `bgm.pcm.raw` file, that can be copied to the *sound* subfolder in your theme folder.

Unlike sfx.bin, *bgm.pcm.raw* can be arbitrarily large.
