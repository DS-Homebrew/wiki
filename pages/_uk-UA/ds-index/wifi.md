- On Nintendo DS applications, you can only use WEP and Open Wi-Fi security settings
- On Nintendo DSi-Enhanced/Exclusive applications running in DSi Mode, you have the additional options of WPA and WPA2 security

Hotspots are usable, so you don't need to change your router configuration.

### Creating a hotspot
There are guides for creating a DS-compatible hotspot on macOS and Linux computers on GBAtemp.
- [macOS](https://gbatemp.net/threads/571658)
- [Linux](https://gbatemp.net/threads/543283)

An Android mobile hotspot set to Open (none) security would also work.

Windows cannot create a compatible hotspot, so Windows users will need to boot into Linux in order to set one up.
#### Other methods
If you cannot create a DS-compatible hotspot using the above methods, you may be able to use another method.
- Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector
  - While this can still be used, it is not recommended because it requires a 32-bit version of Windows XP or Vista
  - For information on setting up a Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector, read Section 3 of this [Wiimmfi Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f3PChwQig40UaiPXlh-Gi5CggGiBPzyrpiecLZlT8ZE/edit?usp=sharing) written by members of the [Mario Kart DS Network](https://discord.gg/pa9bea6)
- Changing router settings to be DS-compatible
  - This is not recommended because it opens your network to intruders, even if you use WEP security. It may also cause issues for other users of your network. If you choose to do this, it is recommended that you use a secondary router or guest network, if available
  - Not all routers support guest networks or turning security off
- Wi-Fi extenders

#### Settings
If you are setting up a network to be DS-compatible, it must meet the following specifications:
- WEP or Open (none) security
- 2.4 GHz wireless frequency
- 802.11b wireless mode
  - This may be listed as "Legacy mode" or something similar

### Nintendo DS WFC restoration
1. Launch Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Setup
1. Connect to your access point
1. Set your Primary DNS value as one of the values below, depending on which service you want to use:
   - **[Wiimmfi](https://wiimmfi.de)** - `167.86.108.126` or `178.62.43.212`
   - **[AltWFC/WFCZwei](https://save-nintendo-wifi.com/) ([online player list](http://zwei.moe:9001))** - `172.104.88.237`
1. Set `1.1.1.1` as your secondary DNS
1. You might need to NoSSL patch your game at this point, depending on the game

### Manually patching your DS ROMs
Follow the guide below in case your ISP blocks custom DNS servers, otherwise it is *strongly* recommended to follow the guide above.

- Users of GNU/Linux and macOS can follow very similar instructions, but will have to use Mono
- WfcPatcher currently doesn't support DSiWare

1. Download [WfcPatcher](https://github.com/AdmiralCurtiss/WfcPatcher/releases)
1. Copy the ROM of the game you want to patch to the same folder where WfcPatcher is saved and open that folder
1. Create a text file
1. In the file, enter `wfcpatcher.exe %1 --domain wiimmfi.de` then save the text file with the name `patch.bat` and close the window
   - You can replace wiimmfi.de with another URL, if you wish to use a different server
   - If the file still appears to be a text document, [enable file name extensions](https://dsi.cfw.guide/file-extensions-%28windows%29) and remove `.txt` from the file name
1. Now drag all the ROMs you wish to patch on to patch.bat
1. Done! the patched ROMs will be the ones ending in (wiimmfi)

Don't forget to remove any DNS you might have saved on your Wi-Fi settings before attempting to connect with the patched ROM.

### Troubleshooting and further reading
If you are receiving any errors, you can enter the error code in Wiimmfi's [troubleshooter](https://wiimmfi.de/error) for ways to fix it.
