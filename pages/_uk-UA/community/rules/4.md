### 4. Maintain the chat quality to the expectations set by the environment

- Monologuing to the point of discouraging others from interacting or having the message overflow an average mobile screen should have the messages moved to a dedicated page, such as a server thread or Mystbin: https://mystb.in/
- GIFs to complement messages are fun, but GIFs made to replace conversation is just irritating and bandwidth wasting.
- Keep needed messages for your point to a minimal, by:
    - NOT duplicating messages, especially in different channels
    - NOT posting for the sake of posting ("chat is dead", copypastas, etc)
    - NOT sending multiple messages with few words each to build a sentence (ie: popcorning)
    - using reactions to post simple emoji's responding to another's message (for the message immediately above, type `+:emojiname:` as a shortcut)

**Moderators may request a discussion to stop, and users are expected to comply with its request, even if it doesn't fall into any of the above examples**
