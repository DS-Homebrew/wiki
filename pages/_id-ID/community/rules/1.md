### 1. Do not act disrespectfully towards others and their beliefs

- This applies to everyone regardless of their role or level of activity in this server, even if they arenâ€™t on the server
- Do not backseat moderate or try to "help" when a moderator is already dealing with a situation
- Reminders of the rules are fine, as long as you remain respectful
- Credit the creator(s) when sending something if you know who created it (exception being when the included work already credits said author)
