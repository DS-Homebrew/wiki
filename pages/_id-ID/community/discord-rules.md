This page provides more details to the rules outlined in the [#info-and-rules](https://discord.com/channels/283769550611152897/626620520330428436) channel in the Discord server. If you have any further questions, ask in [#community-meta](https://discord.com/channels/283769550611152897/715651368391671919). Note that the [English version of the rules](/community/discord-rules) is the canonical version and any potential discrepancies in translations will not affect their enforcement.

### 1. Do not act disrespectfully towards others and their beliefs

- This applies to everyone regardless of their role or level of activity in this server, even if they aren’t on the server
- Do not backseat moderate or try to "help" when a moderator is already dealing with a situation
- Reminders of the rules are fine, as long as you remain respectful
- Credit the creator(s) when sending something if you know who created it

### 2. Do not bring the chat quality down

Examples of what breaks this rule include:
- Meminta disuapi informasi saking malasnya atau menyuapi ke yang lain
- Asking for release dates for projects; it's ready when it's ready
- Asking if you can ask a question; just ask your question directly
- Requesting information that is either obvious or you could find with a little bit of research on your end
   - Important information can be found in  [#useful-resources](https://discord.com/channels/283769550611152897/638041441079263283) and in the pinned messages of all the channels
- Taking up excessive space in chat (e.g. Sending a tiny amount of words in multiple messages instead of keeping it all in one message)
- Repeating messages, whether it is repeated in the same channel or in multiple channels
 - If you're unsure where to post your message check the channel topics and ask in the most fitting one
   - If you're still unsure, ask in [#community-meta](https://discord.com/channels/283769550611152897/715651368391671919)
- Posting for the sake of posting rather than to bring actual conversations (such as complaining that the chat is dead, only sending out greetings, copypastas, etc)
- Sending extremely long messages, use [mystbin](https://mystb.in/) for longer messages instead

### 3. Do not self-promote with no context or without explicit staff permission

- Giving links to other Discord servers on request is allowed, but please ask a moderator in a DM before advertising a server without prior context
- DM advertisements aren't allowed, both by the Discord Terms of Service and our server rules, mass DM advertisement (with proof) will land you a ban
- Joining for the purpose of advertising your discord server will land you a ban and your advertisements will be deleted

### 4. Avoid piracy discussion

- Do not link/mention piracy websites/tools, upload pirated content, or encourage others to pirate
- For more information on what is piracy or not, we suggest reading [eip’s piracy definition page](https://3ds.eiphax.tech/piracy.html) (Disclaimer: We are not lawyers)
- Discord’s Terms of Service follow the US law and as such, is subject to the US definition of piracy regardless of wherever the user lives in the US or not

### 5. Keep conversations within their respective channels

- Even if they are related, sometimes another channel would be more suitable
   - Check the channel topics for where to ask questions or have discussion
- Sometimes, even an entirely different server is preferable, we don't have the answers to everything
   - There are some related servers in [#useful-resources](https://discord.com/channels/283769550611152897/638041441079263283) and the pins of other channels

### 6. Keep all conversations in English

- We are not able to easily moderate content in other languages
- We suggest using [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) for translation
- Moderators may allow others to speak in foreign languages in case translation fails and there are trusted people that know your language and are able to help

### 7. You may not have an alternative account on this server without staff permission

- One account per person at a time (except when approved by a staff member), be sure to leave this server on your other account before joining with a new one
- Punishments apply to the person, not the account, any subsequent accounts made for the purposes of punishment evasion will result in both accounts being banned

### 8. Keep names/nicknames exclusively alphanumeric and do not hoist

- Users with a nickname/username that is not easily readable for an English speaker or mentionable with an English (US) keyboard will be assigned a new nickname
- Avoid purposely putting characters in the beginning of the name to change your spot in the member list, those characters will be removed

### 9. Do not send unsolicited DMs to other users

- Please ask before sending a Direct Message to others and respect those not wanting to communicate
   - Even if your actions aren't malicious, they could be disturbing or otherwise unwanted
- Things that happen in Direct Messages **are** the business of the server since unless you both share another server or are friends, you wouldn't be able to reach each other
- Examples of what not to do include DM advertising, purposely redirecting users to DMs from normal chat (such as support) to break rules, and harassment


### 10. Do not bring external drama, NSFW, or illegal content into the server

- If you are banned in other servers, avoid talking about it here
   - We can not help you get unbanned from other servers, that is the decision of the staff members there
- Do not post anything that is not considered safe for work (e.g. sexual content, extreme violence, drugs)
- Any account with a disturbing avatar will be kicked, if you rejoin and still have the avatar, you will be banned
- Despite adult content being banned, users are still required to be thirteen and over in order to participate on this Discord server as per the Discord TOS

### 11. Do not talk about or do actions pertaining to breaking other Discord TOS
- [Link to Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)
- [Link to community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)
- Trying to do anything that is not explicitly mentioned in our rules but is still against Discord TOS will land you a ban (e.g. raids, malware, phishing)

### 12. Do not try to evade the rules as this will be treated as breaking them

- If you don't understand any of the rules, feel free to ask for further clarification
- Breaking the rules and then claiming that you “didn’t know” will still make you guilty of breaking them
- Trying to get around the rules by speaking in vague terms also counts as breaking them

## Consequences

The consequences of breaking these rules are a warning, mute, kick or ban. Of course, the specific consequences will be handled on a case by case basis.
- Most users end up having 4 warnings before they are banned
   - These warnings include using the actual !warn command, getting muted, and also verbal warnings
- Joining for the purpose of rule breaking will get you banned

## Reporting
- If someone is breaking the rules and a moderator is already not handling the case, please ping an online moderator
- If the incident was in DMs, there needs to be evidence, such as other people reporting it too, implications on the server, or anything of the sort
- However, when doing your report, cover any links; do not give the DM advertiser more visibility than they already got by Direct Messaging everyone
